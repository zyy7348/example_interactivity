clean data.

```{r}
airbnb = read_csv("./data/nyc_airbnb.zip") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename(boro = neighbourhood_group) %>% 
  mutate(rating = review_scores_location / 2) %>% 
  filter(boro == "Manhattan",
         room_type == "Entire home/apt",
         price > 100 & price < 400)
```

### Plotly Scatterplot

```{r}
airbnb %>% 
  mutate(hover_text = str_c("Price: $", price, '\nRating: ', rating)) %>% ## \n create a new line
  plot_ly(x = ~longitude, y = ~latitude, color = ~price,
          text = ~hover_text,
          type = "scatter", mode = "marker", alpha = 0.5)
```


### Plotly boxplot

```{r}
airbnb %>% 
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, price)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~neighbourhood, y = ~price, color = ~neighbourhood,
          colors = "Set2",
          type = "box")
```

### Plotly bar chart

```{r}
airbnb %>% 
  count(neighbourhood) %>% 
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, n)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~neighbourhood, y = ~n, color = ~neighbourhood, 
          type = "bar")
```

### ggplotly

```{r}

  scale_color_viridis() +
